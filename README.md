Advanced To-Do List Application
This is a full-stack to-do list application built with a Python (Flask) backend and a vanilla JavaScript frontend. It has evolved from a simple task manager into a feature-rich, multi-user platform with a clean, modern interface.

The application allows users to register, log in, and manage their own private set of tasks, complete with due dates, priorities, and nested subtasks.
